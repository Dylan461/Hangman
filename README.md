## About Me
<p>Hi my name is Dylan Young. The programming languages that I have learnt is Python, C, C++, and Java. I also have some basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also learnt the basics of how to manage MySQL databases</p>
<p>This was my first attempt at making a project with Python. My preferred langauge is Java, but I am open to learning more languages and improving my skills. My plan is continue making small projects like this, improve the projects over time, and then eventually publish a few applications of my own. I am looking to collaborate with others so if you are interested, please contact me through my email above.</p>
